# Hotspot Analysis of NYC Arrest Data

## Introduction

In this project, we will perform a hotspot analysis of NYC arrests using machine learning. Hotspot analysis is a spatial statistics technique that identifies areas of high and low values (in this case, crime rates) within a defined study area. By using machine learning, we can perform a more precise analysis and identify patterns and relationships in the data that might not be apparent otherwise.

## Motivations

The reason for selecting this topic is to gain insights into the spatial distribution of crime in NYC and identify areas that may require more attention and resources from law enforcement agencies. Hotspot analysis is a powerful tool for identifying crime hotspots and developing evidence-based strategies for crime prevention and reduction.

## Data Description

The data for this project consists of a dataset of NYC arrests from the past five years, obtained from the NYC Open Data portal. The dataset includes information on the date, time, location, type of crime and much more for each arrest. We will preprocess the data to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and in a suitable format for analysis.

## Research Questions

The primary question that we plan to answer with this project is: where are the hotspots of crime in NYC, and what factors may be contributing to the spatial patterns of crime? By performing a hotspot analysis and identifying areas of high and low crime rates, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the spatial distribution of crime and identify potential causes and solutions.
